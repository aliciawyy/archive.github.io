[Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) meetings exist back to 1935. Under Federal Reserve Act, 12 __Reserve Banks__ each makes a discount rate request and the __Board of Governors__ must review the requests, at least every two weeks [1]

- 1-2 days pre-meeting, the board considers the requests.
- every two weeks following the meeting, the board has a full set of updated discount rate recommenadtion for the Reserve Banks.

On *1994*, Congress mandated that Fed must publicly anounce any changes to its policy stance, this makes intermeeting target changes less likely.
