## What it is

Reported _monthly_, the U.S. nonfarm payrolls survey is compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) - a division of the United States Labor Department. It includes important employment data that is comprised through the compilation of two surveys: the household and establishment or payroll survey.

- The household survey is relatively self explanatory â€“ it is based on interviews with U.S. households. 
- The establishment survey is built on interviews with U.S. businesses. This is key to the report as it shows what U.S. manufacturers and other businesses are thinking about when it comes to the economy. If business owners see positive economic growth in the future, they will increase hiring and boost overall survey results.

Aside from the headline figure, additional numbers are released in order to support or deny the Bureau's findings; These include the unemployment rate, average hourly earnings and the manufacturing subcomponent of the report. The manufacturing subcomponent shows specific growth or contraction in the manufacturing sector every month.
